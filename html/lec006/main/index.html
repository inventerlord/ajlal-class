      His Majesty's Theatre is a West End theatre situated in the Haymarket in
      the City of Westminster, London. It stands on the site of the Queen's
      Theatre (1705) designed by John Vanbrugh, where more than 25 operas by
      George Frideric Handel premiered. The present building, designed by
      Charles J. Phipps, was constructed in 1897 for the actor-manager Herbert
      Beerbohm Tree, who established the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA)
      there. In the early 20th century, the theatre hosted spectacular
      productions of Shakespeare and other classical works, and premieres by
      such playwrights as Bernard Shaw and NoÃ«l Coward. The theatre's capacity
      is 1,216 seats, and it was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in 1970.
      LW Theatres has owned the building since 2000. The land beneath it is on a
      long-term lease from the Crown Estate. Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom
      of the Opera has run at His Majesty's since 1986. It was known as "Her
      Majesty's Theatre" during the reigns of Victoria and Elizabeth II. (Full
